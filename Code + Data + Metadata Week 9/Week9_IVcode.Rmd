This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r Libs}

library(data.table)
library(stargazer)

Lets load the data from our files. 

You will have to change the file name in your code. (!!!)

Please check out the resultant dataframe. 
Do you notice a problem with the data? 
```{r Import data}

country_panel_raw <- 
  read.csv('/Users/johannes/Downloads/Data_Extract_From_World_Development_Indicators (10)/3f473c3e-2966-4c5d-ad4d-d550f1d134a4_Data.csv')

colnames(country_panel_raw) <- c("Country",                                                             
 "Year",                                                                     
 "GNI",                                                  
 "Gini",                                         
 "FDI",                        
 "FDI_netinflow",                
 "TransactionCost",
 "RemittancesGDP",                               
  "Remittances",                             
"LiteracyRate",               
"CompulsoryEducation",                                   
"GNIpc",                                  
"Population")


#Total remittances do not captivate the actual level of remittances that arrive at households 
country_panel_raw['RemittancesPC'] <- country_panel_raw['Remittances'] / country_panel_raw['Population'] 

```

 
Right. lot's of missing data. 
The easiest way to deal with it is to just average across multiple years. 
This way we have less overall observations but also less fluctuation in the values.
Look at the resultant dataframe. Are the countries appropriate for our analysis? 

```{r Aggregate}

#There is a lot of missing data in the panel. 
#The easiest way to deal with it is to just average across multiple years. 
#This way we have less overall observations but also less fluctuation in the values. 
panel_aggregate <- aggregate(. ~Country, country_panel_raw, mean, na.action = na.omit)



#calculate remittances per capita
panel_aggregate['RemittancesPC'] <- panel_aggregate['Remittances'] / panel_aggregate['Population'] 

```


Look at the distributions. Are they good to go for an linear model? 
Are there any correlations, patterns, or irregularities that are interesting to you? 

```{r Plot distributions} 

ggpairs(panel_aggregate[c("Gini","FDI_netinflow", "TransactionCost","RemittancesGDP","RemittancesPC","CompulsoryEducation","GNIpc")], title="Distributions and correlations", progress = F) 
```

Get a summary table to see what values we are dealing with. 

```{r Summary Stats}
summary(panel_aggregate[c("Gini","FDI_netinflow", "TransactionCost","RemittancesGDP","RemittancesPC","CompulsoryEducation","GNIpc")])
```

We will now run the most basic regressions. 
Interpret the results.

What do the coefficients tell you? 
How good is the fit of the mode? 
What does the fit of the model tell you?

Do you believe the average transfer cost is a valid instrument? 

Come up with three points of critique/improvements to the model.
Come up with at least one other outcome variable you would like to see investigated. 

```{r Regs}

#this is a regular ols but we add country and year fixed effects to avoid that
#there is bias from the year or the country
OLS_panel <- plm(Gini ~ 
                    log10(RemittancesPC) + 
                    log10(FDI_netinflow) + 
                    CompulsoryEducation + 
                    log10(GNIpc) +  
                    TransactionCost,
                    data = country_panel_raw, index = c('Year', 'Country'))


# an OLS with all variables for the averaged data. 
OLS_aggregate <- lm(Gini ~ 
                    log10(RemittancesPC) + 
                    log10(FDI_netinflow) + 
                    CompulsoryEducation + 
                    log10(GNIpc) +  
                    TransactionCost,
                    data = panel_aggregate)


## Instrument approach. We instrument the remittances per capita with the transaction cost and the other confounding variables

IV_panel <- ivreg(Gini ~ 
                    log10(RemittancesPC) |  
                    TransactionCost + 
                    log10(FDI_netinflow) + 
                    CompulsoryEducation + 
                    log10(GNIpc), 
                  data = country_panel_raw, model = T )

IV_aggregate <- ivreg(Gini ~ 
                    log10(RemittancesPC) |  
                    TransactionCost + 
                    log10(FDI_netinflow) + 
                    CompulsoryEducation + 
                    log10(GNIpc),
                    data = panel_aggregate, model = T)


stargazer(OLS_panel, 
          OLS_aggregate, 
          IV_panel, 
          IV_aggregate, type = 'text')
```
