THIS PRE-CLASS WORK IS THE START TO REPLICATING MISHKIN (1992) ON THE FISHER TEST: https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w3632/w3632.pdf 

COMPLETE THE TASKS BY ADDING THE RELEVANT CODE AND ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS. 
BRING THE YOUR GRAPHS, REGRESSION TABLES, AND ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS TO CLASS TO DISCUSS THEM WITH YOUR PEERS. 


This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

# Data
## Interest Rate Data 
Data Source in SDW: https://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/quickview.do?SERIES_KEY=165.YC.B.U2.EUR.4F.G_N_A.SV_C_YM.SR_1Y 
Read in the interest rate data. 
Do you think the way we impute missing data is correct? Should it be changed? If so how?
```{r}

#Data Source in SDW: https://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/quickview.do?SERIES_KEY=165.YC.B.U2.EUR.4F.G_N_A.SV_C_YM.SR_1Y
#read in the data on the EU yield rates. 
data_yields <- read.csv("/Users/johannes/Desktop/Minerva/International Money & Finance/PCW Week 7/eu_yields.csv")

#convert to dates
data_yields$Date <-as.Date(data_yields$Date, format = "%d.%m.%y")

## We have to impute interest rate values during the weekends

#create a dataframe with all dates between the start and end of the yield data
daily_vec <- seq(as.Date('2004-09-06'), as.Date('2021-02-11'), by = "day")
dateframe <- data.frame(daily_vec)

#add this frame to the existing yield frame to make missing values explicit
data_yields <- merge(data_yields, dateframe, by.x = 'Date', by.y = 'daily_vec', all.x = T, all.y = T)
#fill the missing values with the value one row above. 
data_yields <- data_yields %>% 
  fill(Percent.per.annum, .direction = 'up')
```
```{r}
#check out the yields data. You can comment this out afterwards so it does not keep popping up. 
View(data_yields)
```

## Inflation Data
Read in the inflation data
Task 1: Fill in the equation for the inflation rate.

```{r}
data_inflation <- read.csv("/Users/johannes/Desktop/Minerva/International Money & Finance/PCW Week 7/cpi_eu.csv")

#convert data to dates for merging
data_inflation$DATE <-as.Date(data_inflation$DATE, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
#rename the columns
colnames(data_inflation) <- c('date', 'cpi')

#calcualte the rate of inflation from the CPI
data_inflation$inf <- ((data_inflation$cpi - lag(data_inflation$cpi, 12))/lag(data_inflation$cpi, 12))*100
```

## Full Data Set
```{r}
#merge the datasets on the date
tutorial_data <- merge(data_inflation, data_yields, by.x = 'date', by.y = "Date", all.x = T)
colnames(tutorial_data) <- c('date', 'cpi','inflation','interest')

tutorial_data$future_inf <- shift(tutorial_data$inflation, n = -12)
```

# Plotting
Task 2: Plot inflation and interest rate in one or multiple graph to compare their trends. 
You can transform, subset, or change the data however you please. 
Can you observe a relationship? 

Tip: Use the melt function to convert data into a format that lets you plot multiple series in one graph.
```{r}
#It helps to use a converted format format when trying to plot multiple series. 
df <- melt(tutorial_data[c('date', 'inflation', 'interest', 'future_inf')], id.vars="date")

#plot the three different series in one graph
plot1 <- ggplot(data = subset(df, date > '2004-01-01'), 
                aes(x = date, 
                    y = value,
                    group = variable)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = variable)) +
  labs(x = 'Time', y = 'Percent')
#call on the plot
plot1

```


# Modeling
Task 3: Run a couple of regressions modeliling the relationship between future inflation rates and interest rates using different time frames and using an appropriate lag. 
I have started you off with a regression using a 12 month lag on the whole data set. 

- Do we observe the Fisher Effect? 
Are these result similar to the ones in the Mishkin paper?

- Are there time periods where the coefficient becomes more or less significant?
- Why would this be? 
- What could events be that have lead to the change in interest rates or inflation? 

Tip: 

```{r}
full_reg <- lm(inflation~ lag(interest,12), data = tutorial_data)

# Add more regressions here:
reg_pre08 <- lm(inflation~ lag(interest,12), data = subset(tutorial_data, date < '2008-09-01'))
reg_post08 <- lm(inflation~ lag(interest,12), data = subset(tutorial_data, date > '2008-09-01'))
reg_post15 <- lm(inflation~ lag(interest,12), data = subset(tutorial_data, date > '2015-01-01'))
reg_negative <- lm(inflation~ lag(interest,12), data = subset(tutorial_data, interest < 0))


#compare the regression outputs using the stargazer package:
stargazer(full_reg,
          reg_pre08,
          reg_post08,
          reg_post15,
          reg_negative,
          column.labels = c("full", 'Pre08', "Post08", "Post15", "NegativeInt"),
          title = 'Results Panel', 
          align = T,
          type = 'text')

```

# Time Series Checks

Task 4: Using the adf.test() and the acf() functions, check on for unit roots and autoregression. 
What do the results tell us about the robustness of our results?

You can check the Mishkin paper on how to interpret the adf.test() or check here: https://nwfsc-timeseries.github.io/atsa-labs/sec-boxjenkins-aug-dickey-fuller.html. 
If you don't remember how to interpret correlograms a reminder can be found here: https://nwfsc-timeseries.github.io/atsa-labs/sec-tslab-correlation-within-and-among-time-series.html

```{r}
#subset the data so no NAs are included anymore
completed_dataset <- na.exclude(tutorial_data)

#conduct the augmented Dickey Fuller tests for the two variables
adf.test(completed_dataset$interest)
adf.test(completed_dataset$inflation)
```
```{r}

#check for autoregression
acf(completed_dataset$interest)
acf(completed_dataset$inflation)

````

# Extensions

Task 5: 
- Based on our current results, is there evidence for the Fisher Test?
- If you had the econometrics knowledge, coding, time, and data how would you continue this analysis to make a full replication of Mishkin (1992)
- Come up with one other variable to compare to either inflation or interest rates that may be insightful to the relationship. 
  - why did you choose this variable? 
  
  OPTIONAL: Code up your extensions.
